Task
• Consider only transactions that:
• Are successful
• Belong to category "Electronics"

        "region": "North",
        "stores": [
            {
                "transactions": [
                    {"amount": 200, "category": "Electronics", "successful": True},
                    {"amount": 50, "category": "Electronics", "successful": True},
                    {"amount": 500, "category": "Clothing", "successful": True}

            }
        ]
    },

        "stores": [
            {
                "transactions": [

                    {"amount": 150, "category": "Electronics", "successful": False}
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

Final output: single float (grand total)
